Graph Coloring for Storing Products
Description
This program uses graph coloring algorithms to optimize the storage of hazardous products. The program is based on the Welsh Powell algorithm, which assigns colors to the vertices of a graph such that no adjacent vertices share the same color. The program takes as input a list of products and their incompatibilities, and outputs a graph that shows how to store them in separate groups to minimize the risk of accidents. The program also provides a user interface that allows users to add, remove, or update products and their properties. The program is written in Java and uses JavaFX for the graphical user interface. The program is intended to be a practical and effective solution for managing chemical products while ensuring personnel safety.
